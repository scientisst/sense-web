# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you would like to contribute,
please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository.** This will create a copy of the repository under your
   own account.

2. **Clone the repository.** This will copy the repository to your local
   machine, allowing you to make changes to the code.

3. **Create a new branch.** It is best to create a new branch for each set of
   changes you would like to make. This helps to keep your changes organized and
   makes it easier for you to submit multiple sets of changes as separate pull
   requests.

4. **Make your changes.** This is the fun part! You can use any text editor or
   integrated development environment (IDE) to make changes to the code.

5. **Commit your changes.** This will save your changes to your local
   repository.

6. **Push your changes.** This will upload your changes to your fork of the
   repository on GitHub.

7. **Submit a pull request.** This will ask the maintainers of the repository to
   review and merge your changes into the main codebase.

Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they will be merged into the
main codebase and published to the repository for everyone to use.
